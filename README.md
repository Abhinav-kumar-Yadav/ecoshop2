# Ecoshop - Login and Registration System

This project is a simple web application that implements a user login and registration system with validation using Java Servlets, MySQL, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create an account, log in, and view their profile. It also includes input validation both on the client-side (using JavaScript) and server-side (using Java Servlets).

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing their full name, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with their email and password.
- **Password Strength Validation**: The registration form validates passwords to ensure they are at least 8 characters long and contain a number and a special character.
- **Email Validation**: Ensures that the email provided by the user is in the correct format.
- **Profile Update**: Users can update their profile information, including their name and email.
- **Error Handling**: Displays dynamic error messages when users enter invalid data or leave required fields empty.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for form validation)
- **Backend**: Java (Servlets)
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing user data)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Bootstrap for UI, MySQL Connector/J for Java-MySQL interaction.
